# Midi
Will read a midi file and visualize it (why not make a rythm game out of that while we're at it?)

For now I wanted to make this functionnal in less than 2 days so you can't scroll normally through the application. I'd like to be able to move back and forth in the timeline and handle horizontal zoom. Clicking on the visualiser to edit the midi looks like an obvious feature to add.

- Use mouse wheel to move horizontally, alt+scroll to zoom in/out vertically
